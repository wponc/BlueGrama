            <h3>Blue Grama <span style="font-style: italic;">Bouteloua gracilis</span>
            is a warm season turfgrass native to the western United States and Great Plains. 
            Used primarily for erosion control and forage production, the grass has strong drought
            tolerance and low-maintenance requirements. It can also tolerate saline and 
            alkaline soils, and survive at high elevations where other warm season species 
            would not exist.</h3>

            <h1>Project Objectives</h1>
            <h3>Primarily, this project was conducted to investigate the viability of 
                Blue grama as a low-mainteneance choice for lawns in the transition zone
                of the United States. This viability was determined through response of the 
                grass to selection different post-emerge herbicides, and the manipulaiton of planting
                application dates.

            <h2>Overall & Net Growth</h2>
            <h3>In run 1 (Ava), only control and CR (carfentrazone) witnessed consistent growth throughout the entire timeframe for 
                all three planting application dates. For run 2 (Will), none of the treatments saw consistent growth throughout the entirety of the timeframe
                for all three planting dates. For both runs, growth was not consistent in treatments other than control or quicksilver.

            <h3>Planting date seemed to have a noticeable effect on leaf height throughout the timeframe. Notably, herbicide application 1 week after emergence
            led to more varied results in final leaf height as compared to application 2 or 3 weeks after emergence. </h3>

            <h3>For both runs, CR and MN both had the lowest percent injury rating when averaged across all 3 planting application
                dates. These treatments both only have a single active ingredient, carfentratzone and metasulfuron respectively. 
                While TN similarly has only a single active ingredient (mesotrione), it had the highest average percent injury across 
                all 3 planting application dates in both run 1 and 2.

                days for all three weeks, run 2 had more varied results. Namely,
                there were decreases (TN 1WPE & Q4 2 WPE), as well as some counts 
                that remained constant (Q4 1 WPE & CN 3 WPE).</h3>

                Run 1 witnessed a decrease in tiller counts for both control and TR, while run 2 wintessed a drop in slope of tiller counts for control.

            <h2>Conclusions & Next Steps</h2>
            <h3>Overall, Quicksilver (CR) and Manor (MN) jumped out as the best herbicides to apply for BG health. Both of these treatments had solid overall and net growth. Dependent upon lawn height
                preferences in the region, this may make them the ideal choice. Quicksilver and Manor also had the two lowest average percent injury ratings across the 3 planting application dates. MN
                also had the highest tiller count across both runs, a strong indicator of overall plant health and future growth. Next steps for a project like this could be to dive deeper into the 
                relationship between number of active ingredients and growth over time.
